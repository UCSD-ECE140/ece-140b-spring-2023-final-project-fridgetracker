# Fridge Tracker
The FridgeTracker is a device that sticks to your fridge like a magnet and keeps an inventory of the food items in your fridge, pantry, and kitchen. Add items with a simple barcode scan or voice command, and the FridgeTracker will save it to your inventory, accessible through a mobile app; FridgeTracker keeps track of when food will expire and when to add finished items to your grocery shopping list. Reduce your food waste and easily manage ingredients with the FridgeTracker!
